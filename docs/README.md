## Register your bicycle on chain
Bicycle registration is one of the easiest ways for you to keep a permanent record of the details of your bicycle. If your bicycle is ever lost or stolen, you can use a bicycle registry to help recover your bicycle. 
## Record your trips on chain
Logging your rides is a great way to discover insights into to your riding habits, patterns, routes, etc. Log your trips on-chain and keep track of your trips even if you loose your device, or switch from apps like strava or trailforks. On-chain you have full access control of your trips, and you can, for example, share your trips with regional planners to help improve the biking lanes and infrastructure in your city or town.
## Discover new routes on-chain
You can share and discover new routes on-chain. Found a better way to get to your destination? You can choose to share high-level, non-identifiable details about a route or trip to the meta-chain. Anyone with a bike registered on-chain can subscribe to your route, and tip you money if they like your route. For verification, tips are only exchanged when the tipper has recorded a similar route on-chain. The more you ride and share, the more you can earn!
